# Project-Phase-2
This is my project Phase 2. All explanations on how the code works is already included in the project itself in the form of comments. When it comes to instructions on how to use
the file, use the words that are in 'quotations' as they are the inputs that work. If the code somehow breaks because it can do that randomly, just reactivate the code. Now the block of code located close to the bottom of the project is there to randomly pick a poem or quote from the lists that were defined at the top of the project below the imports. It uses a key made up of the inputs from the user to accurately choose the right list to pull from. That is also the reason why in the comments of the code that I said that the lists would be important later. If you want the Ai to have more options you can add more. However keep in mind that the text will print in a single line. There is infact no limit to the amount of characters that there can be inside of one line. Meaning the user must scroll to the side in order to read the rest of the text. This is the only issue with the code, and it is not a game breaking one either, just something that is inconvenient to the user.
