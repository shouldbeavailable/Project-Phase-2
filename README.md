# Project-Phase-2
This is my project Phase 2. All explanations on how the code works is already included in the project itself in the form of comments. When it comes to instructions on how to use
the file, use the words that are in 'quotations' as they are the inputs that work. If the code somehow breaks because it can do that randomly, just reactivate the code.
